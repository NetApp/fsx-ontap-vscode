NetApp reserves the right to control all aspects of any lawsuit or claim that arises from Your use of the Software or
Documentation. If required by NetApp's agreement with a third party licensor, NetApp's licensor will be a direct and
intended third party beneficiary of this EULA and may enforce it directly against You. NetApp does not waive any of
its rights under this EULA by failing to or delaying the exercise of its rights or partially exercising its rights at any time.
To the extent that any Section of this EULA, or part thereof, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this EULA shall remain in full force and effect. This EULA may not be changed except by a written
amendment executed by an authorized representative of each party. In the event of a dispute between the English
and non-English version of the EULA (where translated for local requirements), the English version of this EULA shall
govern, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. This EULA represents the entire agreement and understanding
between NetApp and You with respect to the Software and Documentation. It supersedes any previous
communications, representations or agreements between NetApp and You and prevails over any conflicting or
additional terms in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or similar communication between the parties.
